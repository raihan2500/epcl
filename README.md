6.	**Close Scanner Properly** – Close the Scanner object to prevent resource leaks.
7.	**Handle Invalid Inputs** – Add input validation to avoid exceptions from incorrect user entries.

10.	**Use an Enhanced For Loop** – Instead of using `for(int j=0; j<l.size(); j++)`, use an enhanced for-loop for better readability.
